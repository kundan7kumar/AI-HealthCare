## Project : Pneumonia Detection from X-Ray Images

It includes,

1. Distill data that are useful for training algorithms to detect pneumonia from a giant set of chest x-ray images taken from actual patients.
2. Build a CNN model to detect the presence or absence of pneumonia.
3. Build wrappers which read medical images from their real-world clinical formats (DICOM).
4. Validation plan of the algorithm for FDA 510(k) submission.
